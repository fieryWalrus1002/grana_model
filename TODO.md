# To Do list:
- overlap agent module with agent that attempts to reduce overlap
- Improve the function to generate random points within the circle

# Done:
- okay so what if whne we create the ObjectData class object, it had some function that returned an iterable object that we could just iterate through for instantiation. 
- spawner doesn't actually spawn anything right now. GOtta work on the way it feeds information from object_data to the PSIIStructure class to instanatiate objects.
- 10-13-21: object scale was verified. Scale is correct as per Helmut email on 10-6-21:
    - In our Biochem paper, Table 3 we estimated 285 nm^2 for a C2S2 particle.
    - A quick search leads to the powerpoint that has a scale bar.
    - also the protein structures that Roma send you should be in scale.
    - IN the TIPS paper (Fig. 1) we estimated that in the stacked area (your red circle) PSII occupies ~50%. That is significant less than you have although we we assumed a similar density of ~1600 per um^-2. Although at that time we used C2S2 only and you use a mix I would assume that the extra sizes of the larger PSII (C2S2M2 and C2S2M) is somehow compensated for by your smaller particles (C2S, C2) that the total area occupation shouldnâ€™t be to different.

# one day ideas:
- does the camera scaling alter the physics? 
    - do we need to scale the object movement?
    - we are already saving the scale information, so we can use it to calculate the appropriate position updates for body posiiont. Sprites
    seem to be working already.DOes this mean it isn't a problem?
- The drawing of circles for particles is not working. not important now. 
- wrap particle into the other objects types. ObjectData should cover all objects, not just psii
